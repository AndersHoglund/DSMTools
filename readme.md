## DSM Forward Programming

Fully functional DSM Forward programming.  You can setup a plane from zero.  Currently only support radios with microcrontroller chip with good amount of RAM memory (like TX16S, Jumper T16/T18, etc)

Working a version that will run on radios with smaller screens (128x64) and much less RAM memory, like FrSky QX7, Radimaster TX12/Zorro/Boxer. The intial version of this low memory has been releases on version 0.54.

## DSM Telemetry Scripts

Many usefull telemetry script to Setup Blade Helis, review RX AS3X/Safe settings, Smart ESC and Battery Status, TextGen

This scripts can run on big (480x272) or small screens (128x64).
Has been tested on Radiomaster TX16S and FrSky QX7

`TextGen` can be used to program your Avian ESC parameters if you have a Spektrum Smart RX and Avian ESC supporting TextGen confuguration. I like the "Reverse" feature of this ESCs. (Requires Edge 2.9.0, or special versions of 2.8.1- See below)

## EdgeTx Firmware with TextGen

Official EdgeTX 2.8.3 Includes my changes for TextGen and other telemetry fixes.
No need to use the custom firmware any more.
