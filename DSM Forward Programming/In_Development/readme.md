In Development.  V0.55
Not for production... only for initial testing..

V0.55 for radios 128x64.   The minimal version should work (almost the same code as in v0.54), but the BW fully functional version has been optimized to reduce memory usage. For sure it does not run on older radios with low memory (QX7, maybe zorro), but i think it could run on Radiomaster Boxter who has a good amount of RAM in the chip. (Only have QX7.. not a Boxter.. runs on the simulator, but don't have a Boxter to test). If you get "syntax error: Dsm...Lib.lua" is really that it did not run due to memory.. could not load other auxiliary code.

To differenciate with the "MIN" (minimal version). the menu lines who navigates to other menus have a ">" at the end.
